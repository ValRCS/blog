The need to generate a globally unique identifier comes up often.

The way described in [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) is popular but it can be done better.

I wrote [betterguid](https://github.com/kjk/betterguid) Go package that does it better.

Unique id generated by this package:

* is a 20 character string, safe to include in urls (no need for escaping)
* consist of 8 bytes of timestamp (millisecond precision) and 9 bytes of random data
* sorts lexicographically
* 72-bits of random data ensures IDs won't collide with IDs generated by other clients
* are monotonically increasing even within the same timestamp

You can read a [longer description](https://www.firebase.com/blog/2015-02-11-firebase-unique-identifiers.html) of the algorithm.

My implementation is based on this [JavaScript code](https://gist.github.com/mikelehen/3596a30bd69384624c11).
