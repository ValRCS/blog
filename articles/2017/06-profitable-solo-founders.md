--------------

People sometimes wonder: can I have a successful business as a single founder?

The answer is: **yes**.

This is a collection of solo-preneur success stories (with occasional 2 people bands).

I only include businesses generating significant revenues. In this context it's around $5k/mo or more, enough to replace full-time salary.

Maybe it'll inspire you to start your own, solo business.

Before you get too excited, keep the following in mind.

This list is the pinnacle of survivorship bias. Solo-preneur software business is not different that any other business, and most businesses fail. You have 10-20% chance of success so pick your idea wisely, work hard and if you fail, do it again.

At the same time, this is only tip of the iceberg. Those are the stories that people shared, cribbed from a few online sources.

There are 100x more successful solo founders that don't share their numbers publicly. A silent majority of successful solo businesses.

### 1. Anonymous making $750k/year with a desktop app, sold via his website

Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13168965

Adivice:
* make a desktop app that you can sell for $50-$300.
* attack a large market that has stagnated or has entranched players with lousy apps i.e. make a better mousetrap.
* electron is a good technology to write such app.

Important factors of success:
* SEO
* good reputation
* big market
* staying alive long enough for word of mouth to kick in

### 2. JollyTurns

Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13170798

Web/iOS/Android app for ski resorts.

Income: unknown.

How it makes money: in-app purchase on iOS/Android ($1 per ski resort or $15 for all of them, see https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jollyturns/id719208522)

First version (iOS only) released in Dec 2013 after 2 1/2 years of work (https://jollyturns.com/blog/first-public-release).

Insight: code is the easy part, marketing is hardest.

Tried to find a partner in SV but couldn't. Wrote code himself, hired people to collect data about ski resorts.

### 3. CRM plugin that finds location of customer's offices based on address of the hotel you're traveling to

Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13167930

Sold for $50. "made pretty good money".

### 4. Niche app, $200k/year after 6 years

Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13170346

Most likely USB driver that allows using USB devices remotely over a network (http://www.virtualhere.com/, https://forum.openwrt.org/search.php?action=show_user_posts&user_id=129043 is same user name as on HN post).

No marketing, gets sales via word of mouth and internet searches.

### 5. Website templates, $100k/year profit

Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13935663

Sold on https://themeforest.net/. Working about 4hrs a week.

### 6. Shopify plugins

Source: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13167990

Makes enough money to hire full-time developer for onboarding of new clients, support and documentation. Does product development himself.

Insight: the trick for coming up with product ideas is to first do custom development. When enough clients are willing to spend a few thousand for a personal implementation of something, that's when you know you have an opportunity to charge 40$ per month for a SaaS version.

### 7. $20k/mo from 3 niche SaaS products

Source:
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13170108
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12066819

Also in the past ran real estate SaaS, making $70k/mo at its height (it then crashed when real estate market crashed).

Advice:
* tip for a newbie would be to look for something niche that solves a pain point or allows your customer to make or save money. For example: if your customer can spend $10/mo on your software and make or save $30/mo from that, you will have no problem getting & keeping customers.
* don't focus on becoming a unicorn. You can make some serious money and build a very comfortable life running a $300k to $1m dollar business, and your chances of succeeding at that are much greater.
* Look for things outside of tech. There are so many problems to solve in small businesses. Many will say there is no money to make with small businesses.
* Learn everything you can about advertising. Get really good at it and be willing to spend money on advertising.
* Be willing to kill something off quickly if it doesn't make money. Test your market early to make sure people will pay for it. I have made the mistake of not doing this and I have lost a lot of money because of it. Now, I need to be able to see a positive ROI on my spend within 3 to 4 months. So if I spent $100 to acquire a customer, I want to be able to get that back + more within 3 to 4 months. I know this timeline is probably really short for a VC funded company, but I have always been bootstrapped so don't have the luxury of risking a longer time-frame for return.
* it is not easy! Prepare to put in long hours especially in the beginning. Prepare for it to take a mental toll at times. You will second guess yourself, feel insecure, be consumed oftentimes with your business.
