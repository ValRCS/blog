[MicroConf](http://www.microconf.com/) is a conference for small/indie/self-funded software businesses. Many of their talks are [available on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user12790628) but not well indexed. They have a [better index](http://www.microconf.com/past-videos/) (and [another here](http://www.microconf.com/growth/past-videos/)) on their website, but also not great.

This is a list of videos and a bit of info about each video. I hope this will help you find a video useful for you.
