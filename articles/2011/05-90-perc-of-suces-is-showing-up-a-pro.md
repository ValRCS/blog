Woody Allen said that 90% of success is showing up. [This
article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/technology/08class.html) is a
proof of that.

In 2007 a Standford professor gave his student a task: build a Facebook
application and get people to use it.

The result? Some applications became so popular that students made good
money out of them. Some even turned into companies.

The important part is that none of those student particularly wanted to
build that app. It was simply something they were told to do.

The challenge in life is that no one tells us to do things that weâ€™ll
own. Sure, at work bosses tell us what to do but the company owns the
result of the work and all potential windfalls.

What the article shows that just by doing something and shipping it to
the world, we might create an unexpected success.
